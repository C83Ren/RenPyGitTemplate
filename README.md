# RenPy Project Template for GitHub Repository
A template project based from RenPy Empty Project that has been optimized for Git repository use.

### Minimum Requirement
> **Minimum RenPy version:** `7.4.6.1693`  
> **Git LFS:**`yes` (you could refer [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) on how to install Git LFS)

### Regarding Git LFS
you could follow the [official instruction](https://git-lfs.github.com/) on how to install Git LFS (I assume all of reader already know how to use Git)  but you don't need to initialize Git LFS (the step 2 of the guide)  as it is already pre-initialized in [`.gitattributes`](https://github.com/C83Ren/RenPyGitTemplate/blob/master/.gitattributes)
